## Welcome

. . .

Welcome everyone in the Analytics track :)

. . .

## Round of introductions

-   Name and affiliation

-   Experience with OMOP

-   Experience with R (or other programming languages)

## Goals of the course

-   **To be able to perform our own studies.**

-   Understand how to create and perform basic manipulations of the cdm object.

-   Basic knowledge of how to create a codelist.

-   Basic knowledge of how to create a cohort.

-   Introduction to the different epidemiological studies: Characterisation, Descriptive epidemiology, Drug Utilisation Studies and Survival analysis.

## How we are going to work

. . .

We have a repo that contains all the practicals:
[https://github.com/oxford-pharmacoepi/RWE_summer_school_2024](https://github.com/oxford-pharmacoepi/RWE_summer_school_2024)

. . .

We will work using R:

a)  Option 1, set up your own laptop: [instructions](https://github.com/oxford-pharmacoepi/RWE_summer_school_2024/tree/main/HDS%20track/00%20setup).

b)  Option 2, We have set up a posit cloud for you: [https://posit.cloud/content/8315965](https://posit.cloud/content/8315965) In this case you will need a posit account.

## SET UP TIME

## Sessions

Two parts:

-   'Package session': A package will be explained with some exercises in between.

-   'General practical': During the week we will have a total of 3h30 to do the general practice

## Your turn

During the 'Package session' when there is a slide with your turn this means that this slide contains exercises. Some of the exercises will show the expected result but not the code to do it. We will have two posits (blue and orange). We will use the post-its following this principle:

-   PINK post-it means: [**HELP :(**]{style="color:#ff99cc;"}

-   YELLOW post-it means: [**WORKING**]{style="color:#e6e600;"}

-   GREEN post-it means: [**I AM DONE :)**]{style="color:#99ff66;"}

. . .

The same will work for the General practice session.
