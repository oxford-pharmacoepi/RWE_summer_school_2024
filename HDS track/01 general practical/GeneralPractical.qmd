## Introduction

Now it is time to apply what you've learnt to another dataset.

Option 1: Use the Eunomia Heart dataset

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Sys.setenv("EUNOMIA_DATA_FOLDER" = here("eunomia"))
CDMConnector::downloadEunomiaData("synthea-heart-10k")
con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(dbdir = eunomia_dir(
  dataset_name = "synthea-heart-10k")))
```

Option 2: Use your own data If you have your own data mapped to the OMOP CDM you can try with that.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# to create a cdm with a random sample of 10,000 people 
cdm <- CDMConnector::cdm_sample(cdm, n = 10000)
```

## Day 01

Get to your know data

-   Connect to your database

-   Create a cdm reference

-   How many people are in your person table? Does everyone have an observation period? What is the maximum number of observation periods a person has?

-   Characterise your condition occurrence table. Can you plot counts of condition occurrence records by year?

-   Summarise anything else you might be interested in!
